# gdi-3d
GDI+ 3D is a simple demonstration of a 3D engine created from scratch using the 2D plotting functions of the GDI+ API. It defines everything from matrices to vectors and meshes, and all of the associated functions and operations required to plot and project a 3D rendering.

Objects can be rotated using the **Arrow** keys (reset with **Enter**) and there are two rendering modes - wireframe and particle (**Space** toggles between them). Also included is a Python script to export meshes from Blender (it is recommended that you triangulate the meshes first).
